    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This project amis to investigative the intricate relationship between Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) events and securities lending activities. Our goal is to provide a nuanced understanding of the interplay between ESG considerations and market activities, offering valuable insights into the considerations of short sellers in the context of ESG events. At the heart of our inquiry lies the pivotal question: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\textbf{Is there a relationship between ESG events and securities lending activity?}$$ \n",
    "$$\\textbf{Do short sellers incorporate ESG events in their investment decisions?}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship between Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) events and securities lending activities is a complex and multifaceted area of study within the financial market. The ESG events range from environmental disasters, social injustices, to governance failuresâ€”impact the behavior of short sellers and the broader securities lending market. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Environmental Events\n",
    "\n",
    "Environmental events can include incidents such as oil spills, deforestation, or emissions scandals. These events often lead to public backlash, regulatory scrutiny, and potentially significant financial impacts on the involved companies. Short sellers, anticipating a drop in stock prices due to these negative outcomes, may increase their activities. Consequently, the demand for borrowing shares of such companies may rise, affecting the securities lending market by increasing loan fees and utilization rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Social Events\n",
    "\n",
    "Social events encompass issues like labor disputes, violations of human rights, and poor working conditions. These incidents can harm a company's reputation, leading to consumer boycotts or loss of investor confidence. Short sellers might view companies embroiled in social controversies as more likely to experience stock price declines, prompting an uptick in short selling activity. This dynamic can alter the supply-demand equilibrium in the securities lending market for the shares of the affected companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Governance Events\n",
    "\n",
    "Governance events involve instances of poor management practices, corruption, executive misconduct, or lack of accountability. Such governance failures can erode investor trust and lead to financial penalties, impacting a company's stock performance. Short sellers often monitor these governance indicators as predictors of potential stock depreciation, influencing their investment strategies and, by extension, the securities lending market through variations in borrowing demand."

    "#### Securities Lending Market Dynamics\n",
    "\n",
    "The Securities Lending Market is a crucial component of the financial markets, providing liquidity and facilitating the smooth functioning of securities trading. In this market, securities are temporarily transferred from one party to another. The lender of the securities, typically institutional investors like pension funds or mutual funds, loans out securities to borrowers, often for the purpose of short selling. The borrower, in return, provides collateral to the lender, which can be cash, other securities, or a letter of credit, and pays a fee based on an agreed-upon percentage of the loaned securities' value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Market dynamics in securities lending are influenced by supply and demand for specific securities. High demand for borrowing certain securities can lead to higher lending fees, making it more profitable for lenders."

    "\n",
    "To study this puzzling fact, we will refer to WRDS database. Wharton Research Data Services (WRDS) is a comprehensive repository of financial, economic, and insurance data. Renowned for its high-quality, reliable information, WRDS is indispensable for conducting precise financial analysis and research. Utilizing the WRDS platform, specifically through the wrds package, enables the swift and efficient extraction of large datasets. This efficiency in data collection affords researchers more time for in-depth analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, we have chosen to utilize multiple datasets, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **RepRisk Library**, which evaluates environmental, social, and governance (ESG) risks, as well as business conduct, using an extensive array of public sources. The incident-based data encompasses a variety of issues such as environmental impacts, labor practices, human rights, supply chain management, corruption, legal disputes, and regulatory violations.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Additionally, this dataset features the RepRisk Index (RRI), which dynamically captures and quantifies reputational risk exposure related to ESG issues. The RepRisk Rating (RRR), ranging from AAA to D, allows for the benchmarking and integration of ESG and business conduct risks.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **IHS Markit library** is a leading, global financial information services company with over 15,000 employees. The company provides independent data, valuations and trade processing across all asset classes in order to enhance transparency, reduce risk and improve operational efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "After thorough data cleaning, analysis, and comparison of the datasets mentioned above, the project will elucidate whether a relationship exists between ESG events and securities lending activities, offering insights into the considerations of short sellers regarding ESG events in their investment strategies."

    "This project aims to empirically examine whether there is a quantifiable relationship between ESG events and changes in securities lending activity, such as variations in short interest ratios, loan supply ratios, and loan fees. By analyzing data on ESG incidents and securities lending metrics, the study seeks to determine if and how short sellers incorporate ESG considerations into their investment decisions, potentially using ESG events as indicators to guide their short-selling strategies. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the realm of securities lending, several key metrics are pivotal for assessing market dynamics and investor sentiment. Below, we delve into the critical ratios and explore additional variables of interest within the Markit dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Ratios\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Short Interest Ratio**: This ratio indicates the proportion of shares that are currently borrowed for short selling compared to the total shares outstanding. A higher ratio suggests a more significant interest in short selling the stock, potentially indicating bearish market sentiment towards the company.\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\\text{Short Interest Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Shares on Loan}}{\\text{Shares Outstanding}} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\frac{\\text{QuantityOnLoan}}{\\text{SHROUT}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Loan Supply Ratio**: This metric measures the availability of shares for lending against the total shares outstanding. It reflects the willingness of shareholders to lend their shares for short selling, indicating the liquidity and accessibility of shares for short sellers.\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\\text{Loan Supply Ratio} = \\frac{\\text{Shares Available to be Lent}}{\\text{Shares Outstanding}} \\quad \\text{or} \\quad \\frac{\\text{LendableQuantity}}{\\text{SHROUT}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Loan Utilization Ratio**: This ratio compares the demand to the supply of loanable shares. A higher utilization rate suggests a strong demand for borrowing shares, often associated with an increased short selling activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\\text{Loan Utilization Ratio} = \\text{Utilisation}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Loan Fee**: The indicative fee associated with borrowing shares. This fee can vary based on the demand and supply dynamics of the loanable shares, acting as a cost indicator for short sellers.\n",
    "\n",
    "   $$\\text{Loan Fee} = \\text{IndicativeFee}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional Variables of Interest in Markit\n",
    "\n",
    "- **LenderConcentration**: Measures the concentration of shares being lent by a small number of lenders. A higher concentration could indicate a less competitive lending market, potentially affecting loan fees and availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **BorrowerConcentration**: Reflects the concentration of shares borrowed by a small number of borrowers. This can highlight the dependency on certain borrowers and potential risks associated with borrower default.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **InventoryConcentration**: Indicates the concentration of shares available for lending held by a few entities. High concentration may suggest potential manipulation or control over the lending market by a limited number of participants.\n",
    "\n",
    "Exploring these ratios and variables provides a comprehensive view of the securities lending market, offering insights into short selling trends, market sentiment, and the operational dynamics of the lending ecosystem."
